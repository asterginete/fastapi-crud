# FastAPI CRUD API

This is a simple CRUD API built using FastAPI for managing a collection of items. The API provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete items, as well as additional functionalities like searching items by name and counting all items.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
   cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY]
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] uvicorn
   ```

## Running the API

1. Start the API server using Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation by visiting:
   ```
